# Notes

* Apologies for the delay in publishing. Juggling work, other commitments. Also on holiday.
* These are still provisional results. 
  * There's a correction to apply, which will hopefully happen by end of November
  * That may have a minor team results amendment
  * Team counters aren't quite right yet (eg. masters aren't yet considered in senior team)
* The main league website is at https://westleague.org.uk, and final results in a more readable and accessible form, will be published there. 
* All the tools and core data will be published on [this github repository](https://github.com/rleyton/westleague). We'd welcome any techies who'd like to get involved.

# Known issues

* Known issue with additional Cambuslang record; TBC
* Aware of a time or position issue around 27:00 that requires a bit of investigation
* Competitions are exclusively by declared age category just now, so eg. a master finishing in overall top 4 for club, doesn't count towards seniors.
