## Introduction

This is a repository for tooling, and public data, for the [West District XC League](https://westleague.org.uk/).

## Anticipated process

* Results will be captured at the event with paper and pencil, by officials and volunteers
  * Times (hh:mm:ss), in finishing order
  * Team number + gender, in finishing order
* These will be (manually) transcribed into (probably) a spreadsheet, converted to CSV
* Initial processing will then occur
  * Creating team results for key competitions
* Teams also submit names + finishing order as a spreadsheet
  * Upload via https://westleague.org.uk/results/submission/
  * These will then be processed, augmenting the existing results with athlete name etc.
* Results will be **provisionally** published
  * Website at https://westleague.org.uk/results
* Once results finalised, they will be marked as **published**
  * Added to data sets in this repository.
