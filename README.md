# Results explainer

- Filenames are of the form `RACE`.`AGECAT`.`GENDER`.`TYPE`.results.`FILETYPE`
- Where:
  - `RACE` is the race name 'on the day', eg. `U11_Boys`, `U11_Girls`, ..., `U17_Combined`, `U20-Senior-Masters_Combined`
  - `AGECAT` is the age category taking part in a race, eg. `U11`, ... `U20`, `SENIOR`, `MASTER`
    - Note that `OVERALL` is a combined for all participants in the Senior race
  - `GENDER` is the gender competition the league currently runs: `male` and `female`
    - Non-binary participants are _currently_ included in the `male` competition results
    - Participants gender is displayed on an individual race result (`M`, `F`, `A`)
  - `TYPE` is the type of results
    - One of `agecat`, `team`, `event` (see below)
  - `FILETYPE` is the file type, eg. `md`, `csv`,`pdf`, `html`
- Result files:
  - `missingTeamSubmissions`: are a report of any clubs missing any names for a race they took part in.
  - `volunteers`: lists the volunteers who made the event happen on the day
  - `agecat.results`: the results for the participants in that age category (mostly relevant for Seniors combined event)
  - `team.results`: the team results and points calculation for that race. See [the league website](https://westleague.org.uk/what-do-i-need-to-know/results-and-points-system/) for more detail.
- Team standings:
  - For each age category + gender, across all events in the League, show the relative placing of each team.
  - This determines the eventual winners of the league.
