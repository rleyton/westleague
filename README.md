# Results explainer
  * Filenames are of the form `RACE`.`AGECAT`.`GENDER`.`TYPE`.results.`FILETYPE`
  * Where:
    * `RACE` is the race name 'on the day', eg. `U11_Boys`, `U11_Girls`, ..., `U17_Combined`, `U20-Senior-Masters_Combined`
    * `AGECAT` is the age category taking part in a race, eg. `U11`, ... `U20`, `SENIOR`, `MASTER`
      * Note that `OVERALL` is a combined for all participants in the Senior race
    * `GENDER` is the gender competition the league currently runs: `male` and `female`
      * Non-binary participants are *currently* included in the `male` competition results
      * Participants gender is displayed on an individual race result (`M`, `F`, `A`)
    * `TYPE` is the type of results
      * One of `agecat`, `team`, `event` (see below)
    * `FILETYPE` is the file type, eg. `md`, `csv`,`pdf`, `html`
  * Result files:
    * `missingTeamSubmissions`: are a report of any clubs missing any names for a race they took part in.
    * `volunteers`: lists the volunteers who made the event happen on the day
    * `agecat.results`: the results for the participants in that age category (mostly relevant for Seniors combined event)
    * `team.results`: the team results and points calculation for that race. See [the league website](https://westleague.org.uk/what-do-i-need-to-know/results-and-points-system/) for more detail.
  * Team standings:

    * This determines the eventual winners of the league.
