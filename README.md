# Results explainer
  * Results are still a bit 'raw', but filenames should hopefully make sense. 
    * We hope to have a 'nice' summary generated soon
  * Filenames generally consist of RACE.AGECAT
    * Note that RACE is the race itself
      * eg. `U11_Boys`, `U11_Girls`, ..., `U17_Combined`, `U20-Senior-Masters_Combined`
    * Age categories taking part in a race are broken out separately, eg. `U20`, `SENIOR`, `MASTER`
      * `OVERALL` is all participants in the Senior race
  * Result files:
    * `missingTeamSubmissions`: are a report of any clubs missing any names for a race they took part in.
    * `volunteers`: lists the volunteers who made the event happen on the day
    * `agecat.results`: the results for the participants in that age category (mostly relevant for Seniors combined event)
    * `team.results`: the team results and points calculation for that race. See [the league website](https://westleague.org.uk/what-do-i-need-to-know/results-and-points-system/) for more detail.
  * Team standings:
    * For each age category + gender, across all events in the League, show the relative placing of each team.
    * This determines the eventual winners of the league.
    * See [the league website](https://westleague.org.uk/what-do-i-need-to-know/results-and-points-system/) for more detail.
